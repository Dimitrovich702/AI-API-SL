 * AI Content Generation Script for Second Life (SL)
 * 
 * This script integrates with Google's Generative Language API to generate AI-driven
 * responses based on public chat messages. When someone sends a message, the script
 * sends the message to the API and receives a response, which is then shown in the
 * local chat of the region.
 * 
 * Setup Instructions:
 * 1. Obtain a valid API key from Google AI Studio.
 *    - Go to https://aistudio.google.com/u/1/apikey?pli=1, sign in with your Google account,
 *      and generate your API key.
 * 2. Replace the placeholder "YOUR KEY HERE" in the `API_URL` variable with your actual API key.
 * 3. Drop this script into a prim or object that will listen to public chat.
 * 4. Once the script is running, it will listen to all chat messages and send them to the
 *    Google API. Any response from the AI will be displayed in the local chat.
 * 
 * How it works:
 * - When a user speaks in public chat, the script listens for their message.
 * - The message is sent to the Google Generative Language API as a JSON request.
 * - The API processes the message and returns a response, which is extracted and displayed
 *   in the local chat of the region.
 * 
 * Notes:
 * - Make sure to protect your API key, as it is linked to your Google account and usage limits.
 * - The API will return text-based responses from the AI model based on the message content.
 * - You can modify the script further if you need additional functionality.
